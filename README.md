# Kaytsters-HappyHomes-Website
#### Web Development on Level 3 at Chesterfield College
I worked on this project from Sep 2022 to Dec 2022

###### Project Brief
For this project, we were required to make some kind of E-Commerce website of our choice. The site could be built using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. No frameworks were permitted. For the development environment we were only permitted to use Notepad (not Notepad++, just normal notepad). Our site must also be accessible.

###### My Project
I chose to create a site to sell houses. I went for a green and orange colour scheme as I felt it was very natural and earthy.
